# Autoencoders
## Welcome!
Welcome to **Image Super Resolution Using Autoencoders in Keras**.An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient data codings in an unsupervised manner. The aim of an autoencoder is to learn a representation (encoding) for a set of data, typically for dimensionality reduction, by training the network to ignore signal “noise”. Along with the reduction side, a reconstructing side is learnt, where the autoencoder tries to generate from the reduced encoding a representation as close as possible to its original input, hence its name. Several variants exist to the basic model, with the aim of forcing the learned representations of the input to assume useful properties. Examples are the regularized autoencoders (Sparse, Denoising and Contractive autoencoders), proven effective in learning representations for subsequent classification tasks, and Variational autoencoders, with their recent applications as generative models. Autoencoders are effectively used for solving many applied problems, from face recognition to acquiring the semantic meaning of words.

## Project Objectives
In this course, we are going to focus on two learning objectives:

1. Understand what autoencoders are and why they are used
2. Design and train an autoencoder to increase the resolution of images with Keras

By the end of this course, you will be able to design and build an autoencoder neural network to create high-resolution images from low-resolution source images.

## Project Structure
The hands on project on **Image Super Resolution Using Autoencoders in Keras** is divided into following tasks:

### Task 1: Project Overview and Import Libraries
### Task 2: What are Autoencoders?
### Task 3: Build the Encoder
### Task 4: Build the Decoder to Complete the Network
### Task 5: Create Dataset and Specify Training Routine
### Task 6: Load the Dataset and Pre-trained Model
### Task 7: Model Predictions and Visualizing the Results
